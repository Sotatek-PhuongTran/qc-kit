## Update Test Cases (6-Step Mandatory Workflow & Logic)

> **Trigger conditions:** This workflow is triggered when EITHER of the following occurs:
> 1. **Requirement change**: The audited UC Readiness Report has been updated (new version). Test cases need to be aligned with the changed requirements.
> 2. **User feedback**: The user provides explicit feedback about gaps, errors, or missing coverage in the existing test cases.

---

### Step 1: Input Analysis (MANDATORY)

#### 1.1 — Load Existing Artifacts

- Identify the highest version of the **existing test cases** file (`docs/QC-REPORT/testcases/[UC-ID]/`).
- Identify the **current audited file** (UC Readiness Report) used to originally generate those test cases.
- Identify the **latest version** of the audited file available now.
- Load all three above. Do NOT generate any output files in this step.

#### 1.2 — Determine the Source of Change

Parse the user's invocation to determine **what triggered this update**:

| Trigger Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **A — Requirement Change** | User says the audited file has a new version. OR the latest audited file version is newer than the one used to generate existing test cases. |
| **B — User Feedback** | User provides explicit feedback about test cases (e.g., "missing cases", "wrong expected result", "need to add X"). |
| **C — Both** | Both requirement change and user feedback are provided simultaneously. |

If the trigger type is ambiguous, ask the user:
> _"Bạn muốn cập nhật test cases vì: (A) Requirement đã thay đổi, (B) Có feedback về test cases hiện tại, hay (C) Cả hai?"_

---

### Step 2: Change Impact Analysis (MANDATORY)

This step replaces the open-ended drafting of generate. The agent MUST focus analysis on **what changed** and **how the change impacts existing test cases**.

#### 2A — If Trigger is Type A (Requirement Change)

Perform a **diff analysis** between the previous and latest audited file:

1. **Identify changed ACs**: List all Acceptance Criteria (ACs) that were added, removed, or modified.
2. **Map ACs to existing TCs**: Using the Requirement Traceability Matrix from the previous summary file, find which test cases are linked to each changed AC.
3. **Classify the impact** for each changed AC:

| Change Type | Impact on Test Cases |
|---|---|
| AC added (new requirement) | → Need to **design new TCs** covering this AC. Apply the same 6-phase logic from `generate-test-cases.md`. |
| AC removed | → **Delete TCs** that exclusively cover this AC. If a TC covers multiple ACs and only one is removed, keep the TC and update its coverage. |
| AC modified (wording, logic, constraint changed) | → **Review and update** linked TCs. Recheck: Expected Result, Pre-conditions, Test Steps for accuracy against the new requirement. |
| AC unchanged | → Existing TCs remain valid. Mark as "No change". |

4. Build an **Impact Table**:

```
| AC ID | Change Type | Linked TC IDs | Action Required |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| AC-03 | Modified    | TC_012, TC_013 | Update Expected Result in TC_012, TC_013 |
| AC-07 | Added       | —              | Design new TCs  |
| AC-10 | Removed     | TC_025         | Delete TC_025   |
```

#### 2B — If Trigger is Type B (User Feedback)

Perform a **feedback classification analysis**:

For each feedback item provided by the user, classify it into one of three categories:

| Feedback Category | Definition | Agent Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Cat 1 — Agent Gap** | The requirement clearly implies this case, but the agent missed it when generating. Example: A validation rule was in the audited file but no TC was created for it. | → Design the missing TC(s). **Also flag this as a skill improvement suggestion** (see Step 2B.3). |
| **Cat 2 — Requirement Gap** | The feedback implies a behavior that is NOT documented in the current audited file. Example: User says "the system should show a warning when X" but X is not in the audited AC list. | → Do NOT design the TC yet. First: **ask the user to confirm and update the audited file** with this new requirement. After confirmation, re-trigger update with the new audited file. |
| **Cat 3 — Factual Correction** | The existing TC has an incorrect expected result, wrong step, or wrong pre-condition — not due to missing requirement, but due to a drafting error. | → Directly fix the existing TC. |

**Step 2B.1 — Analysis output per feedback item:**

For each feedback item, state:
```
Feedback: "[user's feedback text]"
Category: Cat 1 / Cat 2 / Cat 3
Reason: [Explain why you classified it this way, citing the AC ID or noting its absence]
Action: [What the agent will do]
```

**Step 2B.2 — For Cat 2 items:** Ask the user:
> _"Feedback '[summary]' mô tả một hành vi chưa được ghi nhận trong tài liệu requirement (audited file [version]). Để đảm bảo traceability, bạn có thể xác nhận và bổ sung nội dung này vào file audited không? Sau khi cập nhật, tôi sẽ thiết kế test case tương ứng."_

**Step 2B.3 — For Cat 1 items:** After designing the missing TCs, add a **Skill Improvement Flag**:
```
⚠️ SKILL IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTION:
Missing coverage for [type of validation/logic, e.g., "boundary value for max-length field"].
Recommended addition to generate-test-cases.md → Phase 3 (Core Functional Testing):
"[Suggested new rule or checklist item]"
```
Present this to the user and ask:
> _"Trường hợp này bị thiếu do skill chưa cover loại case này. Tôi đề xuất bổ sung vào `generate-test-cases.md` để tránh lặp lại. Bạn có muốn tôi cập nhật skill không?"_

#### 2C — If Trigger is Type C (Both)

Apply both 2A and 2B analyses sequentially. Consolidate the Impact Table and Feedback Analysis into a unified **Change Analysis Report** before proceeding to Step 3.

---

### Step 3: Redesign Affected Test Cases (MANDATORY)

Using the same 6-phase design logic as `generate-test-cases.md`, apply it **only to the impacted scope** identified in Step 2:

- **New TCs**: Design from scratch using the 6-phase logic for the new or changed ACs.
- **Updated TCs**: Rewrite only the affected fields (Steps, Expected Result, Pre-conditions) — keep the TC ID unchanged. Add a note: `[Updated vN — Reason: AC-XX modified]`.
- **Deleted TCs**: Mark as DELETED in the draft — do NOT renumber remaining TCs to avoid traceability breaks.

**Test Case Writing rules (MANDATORY for new and updated TCs):** Apply `.agents/skills/qc-tc-design-report/references/testcase-instruction-rules.md`. Specifically:
- **Test Case Writing rules → Rule 1 (UI Notation Standard)**: wrap on-screen components/labels/placeholders/values in `"Double Quotes"`.
- **Test Case Writing rules → Rule 2 (Content Logic)**: Title starts with `Kiểm tra`/`Xác nhận`; Pre-conditions start with an action; Steps use imperative verbs; Expected Result starts with step number and explicitly describes UI state changes.
- **Language & Encoding → Rule 0a**: preserve Vietnamese diacritics from the source UC document.
- **Test cases example**: read `.agents/skills/qc-tc-design-report/references/Testcasse-refer.md` and align new/updated TCs to the same structural & writing style (TC ID format, Title phrasing, Pre-condition / Step / Expected Result layout, multi-line bullet style).
- For consistency, updated TCs must match the writing style of unchanged TCs in v[N] (do NOT mix styles).

**Sorting rules:** See `.agents/skills/qc-tc-design-report/references/testcase-instruction-rules.md` → "Sheet Layout & Section Headers". GUI before Functional. Within GUI: Screen Initialization → Item Interactions → Common UI cases → UI elements verify. Within FUNC: Happy path → Validation → Error/Exception. When inserting new TCs into v[N+1], place them in the correct sorted position rather than appending at the end.

**TC ID continuity rule:**
- New TCs must continue from the highest existing TC ID (e.g., if TC_025 was the last, new TCs start at TC_026).
- NEVER reuse a deleted TC's ID.

---

### Step 4: Write Draft File (.md) (MANDATORY)

Before generating the `.xlsx`, write the complete updated test case list into the new md file.

- The md file must contain ALL test cases — unchanged, updated, and newly added — in their final form.
- For each changed TC, annotate inline:
  - `[UPDATED — Reason: AC-XX modified]` next to the TC title.
  - `[NEW — AC-XX]` next to the TC title for new cases.
  - Do NOT include deleted TCs in the md file.
- At the bottom of the md file, include the **Updated Requirement Traceability Matrix**:
  - Merge old coverage + new coverage.
  - Mark deleted TCs as `[DELETED]`. Mark new TCs as `[NEW]`. Mark updated TCs as `[UPDATED]`.
  - Ensure 100% coverage for all active ACs in the latest audited file.
---

### Step 5: Output Generation (.xlsx)

Source data comes from the **complete** md file generated in Step 4 (must already contain ALL TCs — unchanged + updated + newly added; deleted TCs excluded). Generate the xlsx by invoking the shared converter script — **do NOT write a new openpyxl script**:

```bash
python .agents/skills/qc-tc-design-report/scripts/md_to_xlsx.py \
  --input-glob "docs/QC-REPORT/testcases/[UC-ID]/[UC-ID]_*_part*.md" \
  --uc-id [UC-ID]
```

If the Step-4 md is a single file (not multi-part), point `--input-glob` at that single file's path. The script:
- Auto-bumps the version: detects the highest existing `*_v{N}.xlsx` in the folder whose name contains the UC id, writes `v{N+1}.xlsx`. Refuses to overwrite.
- Writes everything into the **single `Test cases` sheet** of the template (one sheet only — the previous "GUI sheet / FUNCTION sheet" instruction was incorrect and has been retired). Sheet column headers in row 1 are kept from the template; do NOT rename the sheet or add columns.
- Layout produced: `Screen I header → I.1 GUI section header → all GUI TCs of screen I → I.2 FUNC section header → all FUNC TCs of screen I → Screen II header → II.1 → … → V. … → …` — the order encoded in your md drives the order in the xlsx.
- Header rows go in column B only (other columns blank, not counted as TCs).
- Strips inline annotations (`[NEW]`, `[UPDATED — Reason: …]`) from titles before writing — your draft md keeps them, the xlsx does not.
- Verifies Vietnamese diacritics on sample cells after save and exits non-zero on mojibake.

For **deleted TCs**: simply leave them out of the Step-4 md; the script writes whatever the md contains. Their removal is documented in the Step-6 summary.

**Drafting layout/sorting requirements still apply to Step 4** (see `.agents/skills/qc-tc-design-report/references/testcase-instruction-rules.md` → "Sheet Layout & Section Headers"). Specifically when redrafting the v[N+1] md:
- Preserve the existing screen / GUI / FUNC section headers from v[N].
- Place new TCs **inside the correct section block** for their screen and type — GUI new cases below the matching `<RomanNumeral>.1.` header, FUNC new cases below `<RomanNumeral>.2.`. Do NOT append at the end of the md.
- When the latest audited file adds a new screen, insert a new screen header block (next Roman numeral with its `.1` / `.2` sub-headers) at the appropriate position.
- Sorting within a section: GUI before Functional. Within GUI: Screen Initialization → Item Interactions → Common UI cases → UI elements verify. Within FUNC: Happy path → Validation → Error/Exception.
- Encoding (Rules 0a–0d): UTF-8 md, preserve dấu, no `unicodedata.normalize` / `unidecode` / Latin-1.

### Step 6: Write Update Summary

Save a summary file in the same folder as the Excel. The summary MUST include:

```markdown
## ✅ Test Cases Update Complete

### Update Context
- Trigger: [Type A — Requirement Change / Type B — User Feedback / Type C — Both]
- Previous version: [filename]_v[N].xlsx ([X] cases)
- New version: [filename]_v[N+1].xlsx ([Y] cases)
- Audited file used (previous): [audited_filename_vX]
- Audited file used (new): [audited_filename_vY]
