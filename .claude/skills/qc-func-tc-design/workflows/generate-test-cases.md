## Generate Test Cases (5-Step Mandatory Workflow & Logic)

### Step 1: Input Analysis (MANDATORY)

- Identify the highest version of all the input files (UC Readiness Report, Scenarios). Always select the highest version number available.
- Read the provided documents and comprehend the use case in preparation for test case design.
- Do NOT generate `testcases` files or write Python scripts in this step.

### Step 2: Detailed Drafting (MANDATORY)

Write a draft file.
Follow  6 distinct phases to design test cases:

#### Phase 1: Screen Initialization (Static States)

The agent must verify the landing state of the screen before any user interaction occurs.

- Empty State (No Data): Verify the visibility and specific default attributes of every object on the screen.
  - Explicitly describe placeholders, empty-state icons, or "No Data" messages.
- Populated State (With Data): Verify the default appearance of all items.
  - Describe the default state (Enabled/Disabled) of all components relative to the data present.

#### Phase 2: Item Interactions (Component States)

Verify the behavior of individual UI components without triggering core business logic.

- Navigation & Reset: Check 'X' icons, 'Cancel' buttons, and 'Close' controls to ensure they exit or reset the view as intended.
- Screen Initialization Triggers: Verify that clicking functional buttons correctly opens or initializes the relevant sub-functions or popups.
- Component Verification:
  - Dropdowns: Verify clickability and ensure the correct list of values is displayed.
  - Textboxes/Buttons: Verify states (Clickable, Disabled, Read-only) based on the design or business rules.
- Navigation Tools: Check pagination behavior (Active page, Next/Prev arrows).

#### Phase 3: Core Functional Testing (Logic Analysis)

Apply systematic testing techniques for every specific function available on the screen:

- Happy Path: Execute the successful flow using valid inputs.
- Validation: * Required Fields: Ensure the system blocks saving if mandatory fields are empty.
  - Format: Check Email, Phone, Date, or specific data formats.
  - Range: Check character length or numeric limits.
  - Boundary Value Analysis (BVA): Test at the limits (Min, Max, Min-1, Max+1).
- Exception/Error Handling: Trigger and verify system responses to invalid logic or external errors.

#### Phase 4: Functional Integration

Verify the synergy between different functions on the same screen.

- Example: How a 'Search' action affects 'Pagination', or how 'Deleting' an item updates the list count in real-time.

#### Phase 5: UI-Level Non-Functional Testing

- Security: Check for sensitive data masking (passwords) and input sanitization (SQL Injection/XSS) in UI fields.
- U X/Loading: Verify the presence of loading indicators (spinners) during data fetching and button debounce to prevent double-clicks.

#### Phase 6: GUI & Visual Compliance (Design-to-Code)

This phase focuses exclusively on visual fidelity:

- Design Alignment: Compare every object against the design file (Figma/Mockup) regarding position, color (HEX codes), spacing, and font sizes.
- Responsive Design: Verify the UI rendering across various screen resolutions and aspect ratios.

**Test Case Writing rules (MANDATORY at drafting time):** Apply the rules in `.agents/skills/qc-tc-design-report/references/testcase-instruction-rules.md`. Specifically:
- **Test Case Writing rules → Rule 1 (UI Notation Standard)**: wrap on-screen components/labels/placeholders/values in `"Double Quotes"`.
- **Test Case Writing rules → Rule 2 (Content Logic)**: TC ID format `TC_XXX`; Title starts with `Kiểm tra` / `Xác nhận`; Pre-conditions start with an action; Steps use imperative verbs; Expected Result starts with the step number and explicitly describes UI state changes.
- **Language & Encoding → Rule 0a**: preserve Vietnamese diacritics from the source UC document — do NOT strip dấu when drafting.
- **Test cases example**: read `.agents/skills/qc-tc-design-report/references/Testcasse-refer.md` and use it as the structural & writing-style reference for each draft row (TC ID format, Title phrasing, Pre-condition / Step / Expected Result layout, multi-line bullet style).

### Step 3: Pre-Execution Traceability Matrix

- In the report file, build the `Requirement Traceability Matrix` mapping the file requirement ACs to the drafted Test Case IDs.
- Ensure 100% test coverage before progressing.

### Step 4: Output Generation (.xlsx)

After Steps 1–3 are verified, generate the `.xlsx` by invoking the shared converter script. **Do NOT write a new openpyxl script** — reuse the project script:

```bash
python .agents/skills/qc-tc-design-report/scripts/md_to_xlsx.py \
  --input-glob "docs/QC-REPORT/testcases/[UC-ID]/[UC-ID]_*_part*.md" \
  --uc-id [UC-ID]
```

First-time setup (run once per machine):
```bash
pip install -r .agents/skills/qc-tc-design-report/scripts/requirements.txt
```

The script handles all of the following automatically — do not re-implement:
- Reads the template at `.agents/skills/qc-tc-design-report/templates/[MBFS] Template TestCase - Mobile.xlsx` and writes into the `Test cases` sheet (single sheet, KEEP template's column headers in row 1; do NOT rename the sheet, do NOT add extra columns).
- Auto-versioning: scans `docs/QC-REPORT/testcases/[UC-ID]/` for any existing `*_v{N}.xlsx` whose name contains the UC id, picks the next version. Refuses to overwrite.
- Merges multi-part draft files in `partN` order.
- Inserts header rows (text in column B only, other columns blank, NOT counted as test cases) for `## <Roman>. Màn hình: …` (screen) and `### <Roman>.1./.2. …` (GUI / FUNC sections).
- Strips inline annotations like `[NEW]`, `[UPDATED — …]` from titles.
- Re-opens the saved file and verifies Vietnamese diacritics on sample cells; exits non-zero on mojibake.

**Drafting requirements (still MANDATORY — they shape the md the script reads):**
- **Layout** (see `.agents/skills/qc-tc-design-report/references/testcase-instruction-rules.md` → "Sheet Layout & Section Headers"): single sheet, ordered as `Screen I → I.1 GUI cases → I.2 FUNC cases → Screen II → II.1 GUI cases → II.2 FUNC cases → …`. Roman numerals I, II, III in document order. The screen name MUST match Section 4 of the latest audited UC file — do NOT paraphrase or translate.
- **Sorting** (see same file → "Sheet Layout & Section Headers"): GUI before Functional. Within GUI: Screen Initialization → Item Interactions → Common UI cases → UI elements verify. Within FUNC: Happy path → Validation → Error/Exception.
- **Encoding** (see Rules 0a–0d): write the md as UTF-8, preserve Vietnamese diacritics, never apply `unicodedata.normalize` / `unidecode` / Latin-1 conversion. The script verifies this on the way out.

### Step 5: Write Summary

Save a summary file in the same folder as the md and xlsx files. Include:

```markdown
